# 🚀 NLP Learn and Build

Welcome to **nlp-learn-and-build** — a personal and open-source journey to **learn, experiment, and build real-world NLP and Large Language Model (LLM) projects** from basics to deployment. 🌱🤖

This repository documents my step-by-step progress as I dive deep into Natural Language Processing and related technologies, focusing on:

- 📊 Understanding and working with common data formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet, XML, SQL)  
- 🧹 Text cleaning and preprocessing techniques (regex, emoji removal, language detection)  
- 🧠 Feature engineering methods (TF-IDF, embeddings, metadata)  
- 🤖 Classical machine learning models (Naive Bayes, SVM, XGBoost)  
- 🔥 Transformer and LLM fine-tuning (BERT, RoBERTa, LoRA, QLoRA)  
- 🚀 Deployment pipelines using FastAPI, Docker, and CI/CD  
- 🎯 Capstone projects that combine all learned concepts
